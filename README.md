# TextJustify
This project is a variation of the line justify project. Rather than justifying a line given by the user, this code demonstrates file input and output by reading and justifying a full text file.
"Unjustified" shows the text before justification and "justified" shows the results after justification.
While the program can read in a line, it takes the line and justifies it to 80 characters in the same way as shown in the line justification. After justifying the line, the program writes the result to a text file. Once the program is complete, each line in the text will have been justified and written to the output file.
